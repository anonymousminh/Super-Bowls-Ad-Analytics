# Super-Bowls-Ad-Analytics

In this Analytics Challenge, I and three other members analyzed tweet datasets from X to produce valuable insights about the ad engagement for each brand. We determined the KPIs to determine which ad is doing good versus others. This hackathon is hosted by David Eccles School of Business the University of Utah.
